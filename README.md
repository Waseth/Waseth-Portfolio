# Waseth Portfolio

This is my personal **static portfolio website**, built entirely from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**. It documents my journey as a frontend developer and showcases my skills, projects, and background. The current version reflects my learning progress and what I’ve built so far.
