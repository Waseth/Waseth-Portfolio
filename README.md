# Waseth Portfolio

This is a static portfolio website I’m building from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**. It showcases my projects, skills, and background as a budding frontend developer. I’ll continue updating it as I grow. The current version reflects my present skill level and learning progress.
